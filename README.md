The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: Buying, Maintanance, Doors, Person, Boot & Safety. This database can particularly be useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods. Here, we'll see the use of Decision Tree Classifier algorithm for car evaluation based on the above parameters.
